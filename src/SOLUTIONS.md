vuetify and infrastructure set up for this project took longer than expected due to vue 2 not accepting vuetify 4 - simple solution on browserstack.

had trouble with the 16/9 ratio on the canvas especially in dual streaming mode. This is because i also wanted to support responsive design. I should have started with the basics and took it from there. Solved this issue after using a couple tricks i learned to strech images.

Unfortunately i did not get to have the canvas smallest at 800px and the smallest breakpoint is around 1100px. This is an issue i can work on but chose not to due to time constraints. I am also aware of the issue with the footer buttons not being centered through the whole page. I chose to forgo taking care of this although easy for time constraints.

Had trouble with filenames being too long and some misspelling occured, this is due to the fact i used the assets as they were and did not change their names to something shorter and easier to differentiate. 


- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
I had to work on this assignment on and off throughout the weekend due to family constraints. This took me above what I expected at around 6.5 hours including documentation.


- What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
The canvas and communication between components was harder than i expected.

- What about this assignment did you find unclear?
I did not know what would happen if the user keeps adding sources so i just limited how many the user can add, also I did not know if its ok to have two streams of the same kind.

- What challenges did you face that you did not expect?
I did not expect to waste so much time on overriding the vuetify package, in hindsight maybe that was a mistake. 
Also i did not expect to spend so much time on the ratio css issues.

- Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?
Yes, i found that at first glance i thought it would be a cake walk but it was more difficult than i originally thought.

- Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks, and libraries like React, Vue, etc.
I am most proficient in Vue and therefore used it. I have a lot of knowledge regarding this framwork and its state management which i thought would be beneficial for the time spent on this.


- Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.
I assumed the user cannot add more than 2 streams as those were the options given. I left a bit of an opening to add more in the future but it would still require a bit of refactoring.
