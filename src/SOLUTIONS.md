vuetify and infrastructure set up for this project took longer than expected due to vue 2 not accepting vuetify 4 - simple solution on browserstack.

had trouble with the 16/9 ratio on the canvas especially in dual streaming mode. This is because i also wanted to support responsive design. I should have started with the basics and took it from there. Solved this issue after using a couple tricks i learned to strech images.

Unfortunately i did not get to have the canvas smallest at 800px and the smallest breakpoint is around 1100px. This is an issue i can work on but chose not to due to time constraints.

Had trouble with filenames being too long and some misspelling occured, this is due to the fact i used the assets as they were and did not change their names to something shorter and easier to differentiate.
